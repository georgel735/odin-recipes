# odin-recipes
Hey, yall!
This is my first personal project, courtesy of The Odin Project.
This project is a brief webpage with three different recipes of three of my favorite dishes.
Skills used in this project include the following:
*HTML for web design
*Git for tracking changes I make during the project. Building off Git, I learned to:
--Commit more often and recently
--Write better commit messages
--Basic Git Commands both covered in The Odin Project and ones I had to look up when needed
*Problem solving and being able to research and figure out issues within my code using Online forums such as Stack Overflow.
I know this is archaic and bare but there's always
More to come in the future! (hopefully)
