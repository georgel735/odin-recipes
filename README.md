# odin-recipes
<pre>Hey, yall!</pre>
<pre>This is my first personal project, courtesy of The Odin Project.</pre>
<pre>This project is a brief webpage with three different recipes of three of my favorite dishes.</pre>
<pre>Skills used in this project include the following:</pre>
<pre>*HTML for web design</pre>
<pre>*Git for tracking changes I make during the project. Building off Git, I learned to:</pre>
<pre>--Commit more often and recently</pre>
<pre>--Write better commit messages</pre>
<pre>--Basic Git Commands both covered in The Odin Project and ones I had to look up when needed</pre>
<pre>*Problem solving and being able to research and figure out issues within my code using Online forums such as Stack Overflow.</pre>
<pre>I know this is archaic and bare but there's always</pre>
<pre>More to come in the future! (hopefully)</pre>
